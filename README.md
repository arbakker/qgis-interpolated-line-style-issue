# qgis-interpolated-line-style-issue

Repo for reproducing issue with the new (3.20.4) QGIS [Interpolated Line style](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog320/index.html#feature-interpolated-line-symbol-layer-type-for-vector-layers). 

In short: Interpolated Line style does not handle data which has different projection than the current map projection.
